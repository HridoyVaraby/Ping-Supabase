# Product Context: Supabase Keep-Alive Ping

## Why This Project Exists
Supabase's free tier databases automatically pause after a period of inactivity (typically 7 days). This can be problematic for:
- Development projects that aren't accessed frequently
- Demo applications that need to be ready when shown to clients
- Personal projects with sporadic usage patterns

This solution provides a simple way to prevent database pausing by sending periodic pings to keep the database active.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Database Pausing**: Prevents Supabase free-tier databases from automatically pausing due to inactivity
2. **Cold Start Delays**: Eliminates the delay when accessing a database that has been paused
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Provides a zero-maintenance solution that doesn't require server-side code
4. **Cost Management**: Helps users maintain a working database without upgrading to paid tiers

## How It Should Work
The solution should be:

1. **Simple**: A single HTML file that can be deployed anywhere
2. **Automatic**: Pings the database without user intervention once the page is loaded
3. **Informative**: Provides clear feedback about ping status
4. **Reliable**: Includes retry mechanisms for failed attempts
5. **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage and fast loading

## User Experience Goals

### Target Users
- Developers using Supabase free tier for projects
- Students or hobbyists with limited budgets
- Anyone who needs to maintain an active Supabase database without frequent manual access

### User Journey
1. User configures the HTML file with their Supabase details
2. User deploys the file to a static hosting provider
3. User visits the page occasionally or sets up automated visits
4. The page automatically pings the database and shows status
5. The database remains active without manual intervention

### Experience Principles
- **Transparency**: Clear indication of ping status and timing
- **Reliability**: Consistent functioning with error handling
- **Simplicity**: Minimal configuration and maintenance required
- **Efficiency**: Low resource usage and fast performance

### Success Metrics
- Database remains active without pausing
- User receives clear feedback about ping status
- Solution requires minimal attention after initial setup
