# Active Context: Supabase Keep-Alive Ping

## Current Focus
The project has been successfully implemented with a minimal HTML page that pings a Supabase database to prevent it from pausing due to inactivity.

## Recent Changes
- Created index.html with embedded JavaScript for pinging Supabase
- Added styling for a clean, responsive UI
- Implemented automatic pinging functionality (initial + every 10 minutes)
- Added visual status indicators and console logging
- Created comprehensive README with setup and hosting instructions

## Recent Changes
- Fixed the ping endpoint to use `/rest/v1/_health` instead of `/rest/v1/` for more reliable health checks

## Next Steps
The core functionality is complete. Users need to:

1. Replace the placeholder values in index.html with their actual Supabase details:
   ```javascript
   const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://your-project-id.supabase.co';
   const SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your-supabase-public-key';
   ```

2. Deploy the solution to a static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)

## Active Decisions
- Used a simple fetch request to the RPC endpoint for minimal overhead
- Implemented automatic retries on failure (after 1 minute)
- Chose a clean, minimal UI to ensure fast loading
- Used only vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies) for maximum compatibility

## Project Insights
- The solution is intentionally simple to ensure reliability
- The page needs to remain open in a browser tab to continue pinging
- For more reliable pinging, users should consider setting up a scheduled task or cron job to visit the URL
