# Progress: Supabase Keep-Alive Ping

## What Works
- ✅ HTML page with responsive design
- ✅ JavaScript function that triggers a Supabase API request
- ✅ Fetch request to Supabase RPC (`now()`) endpoint
- ✅ Automatic pinging (initial + every 10 minutes)
- ✅ Visual status indicators
- ✅ Console logging for debugging
- ✅ Retry mechanism on failure

## What's Left to Build
The core functionality is complete. Users need to:

1. Configure their Supabase details in the index.html file
2. Deploy to a static hosting provider

## Current Status
**COMPLETE** - The project has been successfully implemented according to all requirements.

## Known Issues
- None at this time

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
The initial approach was to create a minimal solution that would:
- Send a request to Supabase on page load
- Log the result in the console

### Enhancements Added
- Added visual UI with status indicators
- Implemented automatic pinging every 10 minutes
- Added retry mechanism on failure
- Created comprehensive documentation

### Final Implementation
The final implementation provides a complete solution that:
- Is easy to configure and deploy
- Provides visual feedback
- Automatically pings at regular intervals
- Handles errors gracefully
- Requires no dependencies or complex setup
